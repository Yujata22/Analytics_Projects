Project : Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation

This notebook encompasses an in-depth exploration of Amazon product reviews utilizing the Kaggle amazon-sales-dataset. The analysis unfolds in a structured manner, beginning with initial data cleaning and subsequent exploratory data analysis (EDA). K-means clustering is then employed, followed by a meticulous fine-tuning process through hyperparameter optimization. The culmination involves the identification of three distinct customer segments. The analysis concludes with a product recommendation system utilizing Cosine similarity, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of customer preferences and behavior within the Amazon sales dataset.
